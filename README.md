# Data Analysis using PySpark

This project demonstrates how to perform **data analysis with PySpark**, leveraging the power of **Apache Spark** for big data processing.  
It includes reading datasets, cleaning and transforming data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and generating insights.

📖 Overview
- ✅ Data ingestion using PySpark  
- ✅ Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- ✅ Using Spark SQL and DataFrame API  
- ✅ Basic visualizations for better insights  

This project serves as a starting point for beginners in **Big Data & Data Engineering** who want hands-on practice with PySpark.
